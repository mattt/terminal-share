**Mac OS X Sharing Services... As A Service**

Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion introduced [built-in sharing](http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#builtin-sharing). Access to this system-level feature is provided through [`NSSharingService`](http://developer.apple.com/library/Mac/#documentation/AppKit/Reference/NSSharingService_Class/Reference/Reference.html).

It does everything from posting to Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Vimeo, & YouTube, to adding content to your Safari Reading List or iPhoto or Aperture Library, as well as sending files over airdrop or e-mail. It even supports Chinese web services like Sina Weibo, Tu Dou, & YouKu. 

`terminal-share` extends access to these APIs by proxying through a simple command-line application. Normally, Apple would provide such a Unix command-line interface through a Foundation Tool.

## Ruby

```ruby
require 'terminal-share'

TerminalShare.share(:twitter, text: "This was shared from the command-line, courtesy of terminal-share, by @mattt", url: "https://github.com/mattt/terminal-share")
```

```
$ terminal-share -service NAME [-text text] [-image /path/to/image] [-video /path/to/video] [-url "http://example.com"]
```

### Example

```
$ terminal-share -service twitter -text "This was shared from the command-line, courtesy of terminal-share, by @mattt" -url "https://github.com/mattt/terminal-share"
```

### Known Issues

At the moment, distributing just the binary in `terminal-share.app/Contents/MacOS` (which was the intended use-case), the app complains about a missing Info.plist and other information. This will hopefully be addressed soon, and be used for the first gem release.
